# Useful Documentation for Software Projects

Good documentation is important in any software project. But for many different
reasons, most projects don't have documentation. It is hard to figure out what
to document, where to do it and how to keep it up-to-date. Making time to figure
these things out is often not possible within the scope of a project, which is
where _Useful Documentation_ comes in.

This project proposes a structure for documentation in modern software projects.
It is designed to capture the most important information in a process that is
transparent, collaborative and extensible.
